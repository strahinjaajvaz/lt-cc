# Link tree coding challenge

This is the coding challenge presented to me by Link Tree.

## Design decisions

- I've left comments throughout the code to describe anything i thought worth describing about design and the overall architecture of the app.

## Optimisations

- Minified all the svgs using this [tool](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/). Average reduction in size was around ~25%.

## TODO:

- If this was a larger application, I'd have used Cypress for E2E testing.
- Normalizing the css with something like [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
- Probably would build it with Next.Js for SEO optimization.
